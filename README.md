# RaspberryHomeMonitor
a remote webcam at home to monitor strangers and send you a email when necessery

  When you are not at home, somebody may break into your house,
but you could know nothing about it.
  If you have a webcamera that support linux, it's time to setup it up
your house and fight back. It may seem useless when usually nobody will 
break into your house. But who knows something unpreditable in
your life. The safest way is to setup a monitor and monitor eveything
that is going on in your house.

This system can do other things, such as frighten somebody
when they break into your house. It can recognize the picture
to indentify something or somebody is moving unexpected.

Mothers working away from home can also setup it to watch babies
and pets.

It is welcome to develop this system together, it's free and does not
cost much, but more secure!


The architecture of this system:
