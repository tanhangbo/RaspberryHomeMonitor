# RaspberryHomeMonitor
a remote webcam at home to monitor strangers and send you a email when necessery

When you are not at home, somebody may break into your house,
but you would know nothing about it.
If you have a webcamera that support linux, it's time to setup
your house and fight back. It may seem useless when usually nobody
will break into your house. But who knows something unpreditable in
your life. The safest way is to setup a monitor and monitor eveything
that is goingon on your house.

This system can do other things, such as frighted somebody
when they break into your house. It can recognize the picture
to indentify something or somebody is moving inexpected.

Mothers working away from home can also setup it to watch babies
and pets.

It is welcome to develop this system together, it's free and cost
not much, but more secure!
